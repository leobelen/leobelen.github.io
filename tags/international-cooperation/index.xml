            &lt;p&gt;In international cooperation, there are several emerging trends that are influencing the way it is carried out. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focus on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): The SDGs, adopted by the United Nations in 2015, have gained great momentum and are guiding the international cooperation agenda. Cooperation efforts focus on addressing the 17 SDGs, ranging from eradicating poverty and hunger, to promoting gender equality, climate action and access to education and health.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Results-based development cooperation: There is a growing emphasis on impact measurement and accountability in international cooperation. The aim is to ensure that programs and projects are effective and generate tangible and measurable results in terms of development. This involves establishing performance indicators, conducting periodic evaluations, and using the results to improve practices and decision-making.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Innovation and technology: Innovation and technology are playing an increasingly important role in international cooperation. Innovative and technological solutions are explored to address development challenges, such as the use of artificial intelligence, mobile technology and digital platforms to improve access to basic services, humanitarian aid delivery and natural resource management.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Public-private collaboration: There is growing collaboration between the public and private sectors in international cooperation. Partnerships between governments, businesses, nonprofits, and civil society are emerging to address common challenges and leverage the resources and expertise of each sector. This includes public-private partnerships for infrastructure projects, corporate social responsibility programs and collaborations in areas such as health, education and entrepreneurship.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resilience and risk management focus: With the increase in natural disasters, conflicts and climate challenges, international cooperation is increasingly focusing on building resilience and risk management. This involves strengthening countries&#39; capacity to resist, adapt and recover from crises, and promoting disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation strategies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These trends reflect the evolution of international cooperation towards a more results-focused, sustainable, innovative and collaborative approach. As global challenges become more complex, these trends are expected to continue influencing the way international cooperation is carried out.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>International Cooperation: Origins of the Funds</title>

&lt;p&gt;Not all aid received is the same and within the framework of International Technical Cooperation (ITC) this is no different. This post will deal only with the ITC, which is characterized by being non-reimbursable, unlike the funds granted by the Credit Agencies (CA) - for example the World Bank - as a loan. In the ITC, funds are not obtained, but inputs such as consultancies, equipment, training, technology transfer, among others.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>International Financing in Government and Staff Behaviour</title>

&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of this post on the basic principles of international financing, the term &amp;quot;Credit Agency (CA)&amp;quot; will be the one that grants a loan to a State, and the one that grants non-reimbursable resources &amp;quot;International Cooperation Agency or donor (ICA)&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference between both sources is that a loan (CA) must be repaid by the State and a cooperation resource (ICA) is non-reimbursable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both loans (CA) and grants (ICA) are structured through a project or program, depending on the grantor.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Seeking Help to Finance  Projects in Government: International Cooperation</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/post/2023-01-31-buscando-ayuda/</link>

            &lt;p&gt;Welcome to a new year with a very interesting topic: The financing methods of Government institutions. I mean, not so much for its content, but the distance between what the common people believe and what it really is. For this article we have the help of one of the greatest specialists in International Cooperation in Argentina, Dr. Raquel Deas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to implementing changes in Government structures, financial resources determine almost all of the scope, since if funds are scarce or are not stable over time they will simply make the project unfeasible. In this sense, we can indicate that there are different forms of financing, for example International Cooperation, which will be discussed in this post.&lt;/p&gt;
