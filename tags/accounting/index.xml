            &lt;p&gt;Tax collection is a critical issue for developing countries, as it provides the revenue needed to fund public services, infrastructure, and economic development. However, many developing nations struggle with low tax compliance and collection rates. One potential solution that has been gaining attention is the adoption of accrual accounting principles by governments and tax authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accrual accounting is an accounting method that records revenues and expenses when they are incurred, rather than when cash is exchanged. This provides a more accurate picture of a company or organization&#39;s financial position and performance compared to cash basis accounting&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. While accrual accounting is the standard for businesses worldwide, many governments still use cash basis accounting, recording transactions only when cash is received or paid out.&lt;/p&gt;
