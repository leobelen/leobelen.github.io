            &lt;p&gt;Tax administration is a critical function for governments in the developing world, as it provides the revenue needed to fund essential public services and infrastructure. However, tax administrations in these countries often face significant challenges that can hinder their effectiveness and efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;challenges-in-developing-countries&#34;&gt;Challenges in Developing Countries&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the primary challenges is the large informal sector, where economic activity takes place outside the formal tax system. This makes it difficult for tax administrations to accurately identify and assess the tax liabilities of a significant portion of the population&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Additionally, many developing countries struggle with low taxpayer compliance, as citizens may be distrustful of the government or lack understanding of their tax obligations&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;This thesis was motivated by the lack of specific literature for organizational change in state structures mainly dedicated to tax administration, which has generated a culture of empiricism that can be clearly appreciated in different parts of the world, as will be seen during the developing. In principle, today the &amp;quot;engine of change&amp;quot; par excellence turns out to be technology (that is, the implementation of an ITAS or administrative management program), however, this factor is one among many others. In particular, this thesis was carried out in order to analyze the impact of the human factor on paradigmatic changes in tax administrations and the improvements that can be introduced to maximize them. For this, the applicable theory was analyzed and surveys have been carried out in different administrations (including organizations in Argentina, Guatemala and Barbados) and a series of interviews with specialists in the field.&lt;/p&gt;
