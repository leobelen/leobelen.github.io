          &lt;p&gt;Tax administration is a crucial component of any government&#39;s fiscal policy, as it provides the necessary revenue to fund public services and infrastructure. However, in the third world, tax administration often faces significant challenges due to limited resources, corruption, and inadequate infrastructure. In this blog post, we will explore the key areas to prioritize when aiming to improve tax collection with minimal resources and discuss the sole area that should be set as the priority in extreme cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;challenges-in-tax-administration-in-the-third-world&#34;&gt;Challenges in Tax Administration in the Third World&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tax administration in the third world is often plagued by several challenges, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Limited Resources&lt;/em&gt;: Many developing countries have limited financial resources, which hinders their ability to invest in effective tax administration systems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Corruption&lt;/em&gt;: Corruption is a significant obstacle to effective tax administration, as it can lead to tax evasion and undermine public trust in the government.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Inadequate Infrastructure&lt;/em&gt;: Inadequate infrastructure, such as lack of technology and inadequate transportation networks, can hinder the efficient collection of taxes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;prioritizing-areas-for-improved-tax-collection&#34;&gt;Prioritizing Areas for Improved Tax Collection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To improve tax collection with minimal resources, the following areas should be prioritized:
Simplification of Tax Laws: Simplifying tax laws can make it easier for taxpayers to comply with tax regulations, reducing the likelihood of errors and disputes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Enhanced Taxpayer Education&lt;/em&gt;: Educating taxpayers about their tax obligations can increase compliance and reduce tax evasion.
Improved Taxpayer Service: Providing excellent taxpayer service can increase taxpayer satisfaction and trust in the tax administration system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Effective Tax Audit and Enforcement&lt;/em&gt;: Conducting regular tax audits and enforcing tax laws can help to identify and address tax evasion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Technology Adoption&lt;/em&gt;: Adopting technology, such as electronic filing and payment systems, can streamline tax collection and reduce costs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;prioritizing-in-extreme-cases&#34;&gt;Prioritizing in Extreme Cases&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In extreme cases where resources are severely limited, the sole area that should be set as the priority is:
Taxpayer Education: Educating taxpayers about their tax obligations is crucial in extreme cases, as it can increase compliance and reduce tax evasion. This can be achieved through public awareness campaigns, tax workshops, and other educational initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Effective tax administration is critical for the fiscal sustainability of any government. In the third world, where resources are limited, prioritizing the right areas can help to maximize revenue collection. By simplifying tax laws, enhancing taxpayer education, improving taxpayer service, conducting effective tax audits and enforcement, and adopting technology, governments can improve tax collection with minimal resources. In extreme cases, taxpayer education should be the sole area of focus to increase compliance and reduce tax evasion.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Tax fraud is a significant issue that affects economies worldwide, with estimates suggesting it accounts for between 4% and 15% of the tax gap in various OECD countries&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Combating tax fraud is crucial for maintaining the integrity of tax systems and ensuring governments receive the revenue needed to fund public services. In recent years, tax authorities have increasingly adopted integrated tax administration systems, including artificial intelligence (AI), to enhance their ability to detect and prevent tax fraud. However, the lack of such systems can severely hinder the effectiveness of tax authorities in this endeavor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-importance-of-integrated-tax-administration-systems&#34;&gt;The Importance of Integrated Tax Administration Systems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ITAS are designed to automate and streamline tax administration processes, making it easier for tax authorities to detect and prevent tax fraud&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. These systems can analyze large amounts of data quickly and accurately, identifying patterns and anomalies that may indicate fraudulent activity. For instance, AI-powered systems can analyze financial transactions, income, and asset declarations to identify discrepancies that may suggest tax evasion&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref1:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;successful-examples-of-integrated-tax-administration-systems&#34;&gt;Successful Examples of Integrated Tax Administration Systems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several countries have successfully implemented integrated tax administration systems to combat tax fraud. India&#39;s Income Tax Department uses AI to identify fraudulent applications for input tax credits via false GST registrations&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref2:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Singapore&#39;s Inland Revenue Authority has developed an in-house network visualizer with a graph database to analyze intricate relationships between entities during audits and investigations&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref3:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. These systems have been instrumental in identifying and preventing tax fraud, resulting in significant increases in tax revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-risks-of-a-lacking-itas&#34;&gt;The Risks of a Lacking ITAS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lack of integrated tax administration systems can significantly hinder the ability of tax authorities to detect and prevent tax fraud. Without these systems, tax authorities are forced to rely on manual processes, which are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and prone to errors&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref1:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref1:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This can lead to a significant delay in identifying and addressing tax fraud, allowing fraudsters to continue evading taxes and undermining the integrity of the tax system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-consequences-of-inadequate-tax-administration-systems&#34;&gt;The Consequences of Inadequate Tax Administration Systems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consequences of inadequate tax administration systems can be severe. Tax fraud can lead to significant revenue losses for governments, which can have a negative impact on public services and the overall economy&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref2:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Additionally, tax fraud can undermine public trust in the tax system, leading to a decrease in compliance rates and further exacerbating the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-need-for-effective-integrated-tax-administration-systems&#34;&gt;The Need for Effective Integrated Tax Administration Systems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the lack of integrated tax administration systems can significantly hinder the ability of tax authorities to detect and prevent tax fraud. The adoption of AI and other digital technologies is crucial for enhancing the effectiveness of tax administration systems and ensuring governments receive the revenue needed to fund public services&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref4:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Tax authorities must prioritize the development and implementation of these systems to combat tax fraud and maintain the integrity of the tax system.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Improving Tax Collection in the Developing World Through Accrual Accounting</title>

          &lt;p&gt;Tax collection is a critical issue for developing countries, as it provides the revenue needed to fund public services, infrastructure, and economic development. However, many third world nations struggle with low tax compliance and collection rates. One potential solution that has been gaining attention is the adoption of accrual accounting principles by governments and tax authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accrual accounting is an accounting method that records revenues and expenses when they are incurred, rather than when cash is exchanged. This provides a more accurate picture of a company or organization&#39;s financial position and performance compared to cash basis accounting&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. While accrual accounting is the standard for businesses worldwide, many governments still use cash basis accounting, recording transactions only when cash is received or paid out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adopting accrual accounting can provide several benefits for tax collection in developing countries:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;improved-transparency-and-accountability&#34;&gt;Improved Transparency and Accountability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accrual accounting requires governments to record all assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, providing a more comprehensive view of their financial situation. This increased transparency can help reduce corruption and mismanagement of public funds&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Taxpayers can more easily see how their tax money is being used, increasing trust in the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;better-budgeting-and-planning&#34;&gt;Better Budgeting and Planning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With accrual accounting, governments can more accurately forecast future revenues and expenses. This allows for better budgeting and planning of public services and infrastructure projects&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Tax authorities can use accrual data to project future tax revenues and identify potential shortfalls earlier. This leads to more efficient use of limited resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fairer-tax-system&#34;&gt;Fairer Tax System&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accrual accounting provides a more accurate picture of a taxpayer&#39;s true economic income and ability to pay taxes. Under cash basis accounting, income can be manipulated by timing when cash is received. Accrual accounting prevents this by recording income when it is earned&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref1:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This allows for a fairer, more equitable tax system that is harder to evade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reduced-tax-evasion&#34;&gt;Reduced Tax Evasion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accrual accounting makes it more difficult for taxpayers to hide income or assets. All transactions are recorded, making it harder to underreport income or overstate deductions&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref1:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This reduces the opportunities for tax evasion and increases compliance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;improved-tax-collection-rates&#34;&gt;Improved Tax Collection Rates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By improving transparency, budgeting, fairness and reducing evasion, accrual accounting can lead to higher tax collection rates. Taxpayers are more willing to comply when they trust the system is fair and funds are being used responsibly&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref1:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Tax authorities can more efficiently identify and collect from non-compliant taxpayers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;challenges-of-adopting-accrual-accounting&#34;&gt;Challenges of Adopting Accrual Accounting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the benefits of accrual accounting are clear, implementing it in developing countries faces several challenges:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lack of trained accounting and finance personnel with accrual accounting skills&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref2:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Outdated and inadequate financial management information systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resistance to change from cash basis accounting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upfront costs of transitioning to a new accounting system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lack of political will and commitment to reform&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref2:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To overcome these challenges, developing countries need to invest in training and capacity building of government accountants and finance staff. Modern financial management information systems must be implemented. Change management strategies are critical to overcome resistance to accrual accounting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transitioning to accrual accounting is a long-term process that requires sustained political commitment and support. International organizations like the IMF and World Bank can provide technical assistance and funding to support the transition&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref3:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Peer learning from countries that have successfully implemented accrual accounting, like New Zealand and Australia, can also help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adopting accrual accounting principles can be a powerful tool for improving tax collection in developing countries. By providing greater transparency, fairer taxation, and reduced evasion, accrual accounting can lead to higher tax compliance and revenues. This in turn allows for better public services and economic development.
However, implementing accrual accounting is not easy and requires overcoming significant challenges. With the right political will, technical assistance, and capacity building, developing countries can make the transition and reap the benefits of accrual accounting. Improving tax collection is critical for the future prosperity of the developing world.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Tax administration in developing countries faces significant challenges in collecting revenue efficiently and equitably. Low tax-to-GDP ratios, high rates of informality, limited taxpayer compliance, and outdated technology all hinder the ability of tax authorities to mobilize domestic resources. However, with the right reforms and investments, these obstacles can be overcome to strengthen fiscal capacity and support economic development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-promise-and-limitations-of-technology&#34;&gt;The Promise and Limitations of Technology&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology has immense potential to transform tax administration in developing countries by improving taxpayer identification, enhancing compliance monitoring, and facilitating voluntary compliance&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Digital tools like electronic fiscal devices, e-filing, and e-payments can help tax authorities create comprehensive taxpayer databases, automatically cross-check reported liabilities against third-party data, and provide convenient services to taxpayers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, realizing the full benefits of technology requires overcoming significant barriers. Inadequate infrastructure like electricity and internet access can lead to system failures and user frustration, especially for small businesses and rural taxpayers. Resistance from taxpayers and tax officials, lack of institutional strategy, and outdated regulatory frameworks also limit the impact of new technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address these challenges, tax authorities should adopt a multi-pronged approach. Investing in basic infrastructure and offering alternative solutions like offline filing for underserved groups can mitigate access issues. Robust change management, targeted training, and assistance can help overcome human resistance. Sequencing reforms, cleaning up data, and retraining staff should precede technology rollouts. Policymakers should also update regulations for data sharing and cybersecurity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;improving-compliance-through-behavioral-insights&#34;&gt;Improving Compliance through Behavioral Insights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compliance is a major challenge in developing countries, with high rates of tax evasion and avoidance. Households and firms often underreport income, especially for activities that are harder for authorities to observe. Complexity and lack of awareness also lead to unintentional noncompliance&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behavioral insights offer promising solutions. Simplifying tax processes, providing clear information, and sending reminders can significantly boost compliance. For example, SMS reminders increased tax payments by 6% in Uganda, while simplified information decreased late payments by 23% in Belgium&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref1:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adjusting tax policies can also encourage compliance. Bachas and Soto&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref2:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; found that increasing corporate taxes on profits in Costa Rica led firms to evade by inflating reported costs, suggesting revenue taxes as an alternative. Londono-Velez and Avila-Mehecha&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref3:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; showed that improved information on offshore accounts and amnesty programs had large impacts on wealth tax compliance in Colombia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, not all noncompliance is strategic. Brockmeyer et al.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref4:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; found that failure to pay property taxes in Mexico was often due to limited liquidity rather than evasion. Policymakers should consider taxpayers&#39; circumstances and use a mix of incentives, simplification, and enforcement to promote compliance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;strengthening-tax-administration-capacity&#34;&gt;Strengthening Tax Administration Capacity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing countries face extensive political, economic and administrative challenges in closing tax gaps&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Weak institutional capacity, lack of skilled staff, and corruption undermine the effectiveness of tax administrations&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Reforms are often difficult due to vested interests and resistance to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building sustainable capacity requires a long-term, holistic approach. Investing in human capital through training and performance management is crucial. Organizational restructuring, risk-based audits, and large taxpayer units can improve efficiency. Enhancing taxpayer services and communication can increase voluntary compliance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Political leadership and a whole-of-government approach are essential for successful reforms. Policymakers should champion modernization, align tax policies with development goals, and coordinate with other agencies. Engaging stakeholders, managing change, and monitoring progress are also key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;leveraging-international-cooperation&#34;&gt;Leveraging International Cooperation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an increasingly globalized world, international cooperation is vital for tackling cross-border tax challenges. Aggressive tax planning and transfer mispricing by multinational corporations lead to huge revenue losses for developing countries, far exceeding foreign aid. Tax incentives, though ineffective at attracting investment, still result in significant forgone revenue&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref1:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The international community has taken steps to address these issues, such as the OECD&#39;s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project and the Addis Tax Initiative. However, more action is needed to ensure that developing countries can fully participate in and benefit from global tax reforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developed countries and international organizations should provide technical assistance, capacity building, and financial support to help developing countries strengthen their tax systems. Sharing best practices, facilitating knowledge exchange, and supporting regional cooperation can also accelerate progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, domestic revenue mobilization is a shared responsibility. By working together to overcome challenges and build effective, equitable tax systems, developed and developing countries can unlock the resources needed to achieve sustainable development.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
        
          &lt;p&gt;In today&#39;s digital age, data breaches and leaks have become an increasingly common occurrence, affecting organizations across various sectors, including tax administrations. The sensitive nature of the information handled by tax authorities, such as taxpayer financial data and personal details, makes them prime targets for cyber criminals and malicious actors. Data leaks in tax administrations can have severe consequences, including a breach of taxpayer privacy, financial losses, and a loss of public trust in the government&#39;s ability to safeguard sensitive information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-importance-of-addressing-data-leaks&#34;&gt;The Importance of Addressing Data Leaks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tax administrations have a fundamental responsibility to protect the confidentiality of taxpayer information. Failure to do so can lead to a range of negative outcomes, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taxpayer Privacy Breaches&lt;/strong&gt;: Data leaks can expose sensitive taxpayer information, such as financial records and personal details, leading to a violation of their right to privacy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Financial Losses&lt;/strong&gt;: Taxpayers may suffer financial losses due to identity theft, fraud, or other malicious activities resulting from the leaked data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Erosion of Public Trust&lt;/strong&gt;: Data breaches can undermine the public&#39;s confidence in the tax administration&#39;s ability to handle sensitive information securely, making taxpayers less willing to comply with tax laws and regulations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reputational Damage&lt;/strong&gt;: A data leak can significantly damage the reputation of the tax administration, making it more difficult to maintain effective working relationships with taxpayers and other stakeholders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;strategies-for-preventing-and-mitigating-data-leaks&#34;&gt;Strategies for Preventing and Mitigating Data Leaks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address the threat of data leaks, tax administrations must implement robust security measures and adopt a proactive approach to data protection. Some key strategies include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implementing Strong Security Protocols&lt;/strong&gt;: Tax administrations should ensure that they have comprehensive security protocols in place, including encryption, access controls, and regular security audits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Providing Staff Training&lt;/strong&gt;: Regular staff training on data security best practices, such as identifying phishing attempts and securely handling sensitive information, can help prevent data breaches caused by human error.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regularly Updating Systems&lt;/strong&gt;: Keeping software and systems up-to-date with the latest security patches and updates can help mitigate vulnerabilities and reduce the risk of data breaches.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Developing Incident Response Plans&lt;/strong&gt;: Tax administrations should have well-defined incident response plans in place, outlining the steps to be taken in the event of a data breach, including notification procedures and remediation measures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collaborating with Stakeholders&lt;/strong&gt;: Effective collaboration with other government agencies, law enforcement, and the private sector can help tax administrations stay informed about emerging threats and share best practices for data protection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusions&#34;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data leaks in tax administrations pose a serious threat to taxpayer privacy and the integrity of the tax system. By implementing robust security measures, providing employee training, regularly updating systems, developing incident response plans, and collaborating with stakeholders, tax administrations can work to prevent and mitigate the impact of data breaches. Addressing this critical issue is essential for maintaining public trust and ensuring the continued success of tax administrations in fulfilling their mandate.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
        
          &lt;p&gt;Effective collection in tax and financial administration is crucial for maintaining a healthy financial position and ensuring the smooth operation of an organization. However, collecting outstanding debts can be a challenging task, often requiring a strategic approach and a deep understanding of the various factors that influence collection success. In this blog post, we will explore some key strategies and best practices to improve collection in tax and financial administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;establish-clear-policies-and-procedures&#34;&gt;Establish Clear Policies and Procedures&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A well-defined collection policy is the foundation of any successful collection strategy. It should outline the steps to be taken when a debt becomes overdue, including the communication methods, frequency, and escalation procedures. Clearly defined policies provide a framework for collection staff and help ensure that all parties involved understand their responsibilities and expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;implement-a-robust-collection-system&#34;&gt;Implement a Robust Collection System&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A robust collection system is essential for efficient and effective debt recovery. This includes the use of technology, normally in the form of an Integrated Administration System (IAS) or with automated reminders, online payment portals, and customer relationship management (CRM) software, to streamline the collection process and improve communication with debtors. Additionally, investing in a comprehensive debt recovery software can help automate tasks, track progress, and provide valuable insights into collection performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;prioritize-and-segment-your-debts&#34;&gt;Prioritize and Segment Your Debts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Segmenting your debts based on various factors, such as age, value, and customer behavior, can help you prioritize your collection efforts more effectively. By focusing on the most critical debts first, you can maximize your chances of successful collection and minimize the risk of write-offs. Additionally, prioritizing debts can help you allocate your resources more efficiently and ensure that your collection efforts are targeted and effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;maintain-open-communication-channels&#34;&gt;Maintain Open Communication Channels&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open communication is key to resolving collection issues and maintaining positive relationships with debtors. Regularly updating debtors on their account status, explaining the reasons for any late payments, and addressing any concerns they may have can help to build trust and understanding. Additionally, being transparent about the collection process and the consequences of non-payment can encourage debtors to engage in the collection process and ultimately pay their outstanding debts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;offer-flexible-payment-options&#34;&gt;Offer Flexible Payment Options&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Offering flexible payment options can help to make the collection process more accessible and convenient for debtors. This could include installment plans, payment extensions, or alternative payment methods, such as electronic funds transfers or mobile payments. By providing debtors with a range of payment options, you can increase the likelihood of successful collection and improve the overall customer experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;provide-incentives-for-early-payment&#34;&gt;Provide Incentives for Early Payment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incentives, such as discounts or rewards, can be an effective way to encourage debtors to pay their outstanding debts more quickly. By offering financial incentives for early payment, you can motivate debtors to prioritize their payments and reduce the risk of delinquency. Additionally, providing incentives can help to build goodwill and foster positive relationships with debtors, which can be beneficial for future collections and business opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;monitor-and-evaluate-collection-performance&#34;&gt;Monitor and Evaluate Collection Performance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regularly monitoring and evaluating your collection performance is essential for identifying areas for improvement and ensuring that your collection strategy remains effective. This can include tracking key performance indicators (KPIs), such as collection rates, average days to pay, and write-offs, and using this data to adjust your collection tactics as needed. Additionally, conducting regular audits of your collection processes can help you identify inefficiencies, address any issues, and maintain a high level of collection performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;seek-professional-assistance-when-necessary&#34;&gt;Seek Professional Assistance When Necessary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some cases, collecting outstanding debts may require the assistance of a professional debt recovery agency or legal counsel. By engaging the services of a reputable debt recovery agency, you can benefit from their expertise, resources, and collection methods, which can help to improve your collection success rates. Additionally, working with a legal professional can provide you with guidance on the most effective collection strategies and the legal options available to you in case of non-payment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Improving collection in tax and financial administration requires a strategic approach and a deep understanding of the various factors that influence collection success. By implementing clear policies and procedures, leveraging technology, prioritizing debts, maintaining open communication, offering flexible payment options, and monitoring and evaluating collection performance, you can significantly improve your collection success rates and maintain a healthy financial position. Additionally, seeking professional assistance when necessary can provide valuable insights and support in achieving your collection goals. By adopting these best practices and continually refining your collection strategy, you can ensure that your organization remains financially stable and successful.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An important part of the general proposal, initiated by the previous posts (in particular the &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/post/2022-06-22-principios-de-adm-tributaria/&#34;&gt;tax administration manual&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/post/2021-08-01-un-anteproyecto-de-codigo-tributario-argentino/&#34;&gt;draft Tax Code&lt;/a&gt;) is the program that can be used to carry it out. Actually, some time ago I developed an Integrated Tax Administration System (ITAS), called Antares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;architecture&#34;&gt;Architecture&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the beginning, the project was focused as a tool that could meet the following characteristics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;be easy to install and test.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;highly parameterizable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;based on free software technologies (such as the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/&#34;&gt;GNU&lt;/a&gt; license).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of the above, the system works with the following technological components:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.postgresql.org&#34;&gt;Postgres&lt;/a&gt; as a database.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Web interface.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.docker.com&#34;&gt;Docker&lt;/a&gt; as a deployment technology.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;components&#34;&gt;Components&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system provides the tools to fully implement an ITAS, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A parameterizable document manager, which allows editing, viewing and printing (the latter not implemented in the demo).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A checking account, which maintains balances, transactions, and calculates interest and penalties.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A vector of obligations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A workflow manager.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>International Cooperation: Tendencies</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/post/2023-09-11-tendencias-en-cooperacion-internacional/</link>

      <description>
        
          &lt;p&gt;In international cooperation, there are several emerging trends that are influencing the way it is carried out. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focus on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): The SDGs, adopted by the United Nations in 2015, have gained great momentum and are guiding the international cooperation agenda. Cooperation efforts focus on addressing the 17 SDGs, ranging from eradicating poverty and hunger, to promoting gender equality, climate action and access to education and health.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Results-based development cooperation: There is a growing emphasis on impact measurement and accountability in international cooperation. The aim is to ensure that programs and projects are effective and generate tangible and measurable results in terms of development. This involves establishing performance indicators, conducting periodic evaluations, and using the results to improve practices and decision-making.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Innovation and technology: Innovation and technology are playing an increasingly important role in international cooperation. Innovative and technological solutions are explored to address development challenges, such as the use of artificial intelligence, mobile technology and digital platforms to improve access to basic services, humanitarian aid delivery and natural resource management.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Public-private collaboration: There is growing collaboration between the public and private sectors in international cooperation. Partnerships between governments, businesses, nonprofits, and civil society are emerging to address common challenges and leverage the resources and expertise of each sector. This includes public-private partnerships for infrastructure projects, corporate social responsibility programs and collaborations in areas such as health, education and entrepreneurship.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resilience and risk management focus: With the increase in natural disasters, conflicts and climate challenges, international cooperation is increasingly focusing on building resilience and risk management. This involves strengthening countries&#39; capacity to resist, adapt and recover from crises, and promoting disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation strategies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These trends reflect the evolution of international cooperation towards a more results-focused, sustainable, innovative and collaborative approach. As global challenges become more complex, these trends are expected to continue influencing the way international cooperation is carried out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are waiting for you in comments.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>International Cooperation: Origins of the Funds</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/post/2023-05-31-cooperacion-internacional-el-origen-de-los-fondos/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 31 May 2023 00:00:00 -0300</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/post/2023-05-31-cooperacion-internacional-el-origen-de-los-fondos/</guid>
      <description>
        
          &lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all aid received is the same and within the framework of International Technical Cooperation (ITC) this is no different. This post will deal only with the ITC, which is characterized by being non-reimbursable, unlike the funds granted by the Credit Agencies (CA) - for example the World Bank - as a loan. In the ITC, funds are not obtained, but inputs such as consultancies, equipment, training, technology transfer, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a note of color, we will not present real cases, not to confuse them, but as a measure of protection for the parties involved. If necessary, we will take the case exposed in the work &lt;a href=&#34;https://tienda.thomsonreuters.com.ar/978-987-03-4377-6%E2%80%8B-principios-de-tax-administration/p&#34;&gt;Principles of Tax Administration&lt;/a&gt; (In Spanish) of the People&#39;s Republic and Metropolis as a base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;funds-origin&#34;&gt;Fund&#39;s Origin&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;international-government-cooperation-igc&#34;&gt;International Government Cooperation (IGC)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s imagine that a country wants to help a third party through cooperation. It does this with its own resources, originating from the collection of taxes from its citizens, once their needs are covered. However, since resources are finite, the donor country must prioritize aid based on its strategic objectives, which may be economic, social, environmental or other. Then, Bilateral Technical Cooperation (BTC) is called that which occurs directly between two countries, a donor of funds and a recipient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may be the case that - depending on the objectives - the participation of several donors may be necessary for a single recipient, something that can occur in the African continent, forming something that we will call Mixed Bilateral Cooperation (MBC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both in the case of the BTC and the MBC, the management of these resources is carried out through the competent organizations in matters of cooperation of the different donor countries, such as the International Cooperation Agencies (ICA). As an example we can cite &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.usaid.gov&#34;&gt;USAID&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.giz.de/en/html/index.html&#34;&gt;giz&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, it may be the case that several countries come together to promote the advancement of a common axis in what we will call Multilateral Technical Cooperation (MTC), forming Multilateral Organizations for International Cooperation (MOIC). These organizations receive contributions from all their members, based on parameters such as the gross domestic product or GDP (ie, the higher the GDP, the greater the contribution) for channeling them to the different recipients. In other words, in these cases both the donor and recipient countries make contributions to the MOIC, based on the variables approved by the members to determine them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both in the BTC and in the MBC or the MTC, the donor&#39;s interest in the progress of the program on which the funds are based clearly emerges. Ultimately these are funds from taxpayers that could have financed goods and services within their borders but chose to do so elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;non-governmental-international-cooperation-ngic&#34;&gt;Non-Governmental International Cooperation (NGIC)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many cases it is not governments that donate the funds, but may also be non-governmental actors (for example, foundations), whose origin may be civil society donors, such as private banks. We will call these entities Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;quick-recap&#34;&gt;Quick Recap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on all of the above, we can say that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The funds donated arise mainly from taxes that the donor collected or was able to collect and that he was able to use to finance programs within his borders but chose to do so through International Cooperation projects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In return for these funds, the donor must explain to its citizens the progress of the program and therefore has an interest in knowing its progress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since the funds are finite, the donor prioritizes the destination based on their needs and those of the recipients.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All member countries of an MOIC make a contribution, which depends on the amount based on pre-existing parameters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In no case do funds from non-reimbursable contributions come from nowhere, but are always based on taxes collected or that could be collected. In other words, the donations are based on the funds that certain countries (the donors) decided to invest in others with less relative development.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, it is possible to determine that a program will be viable if the following two conditions are true:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The donor country has the funds earmarked for ITC.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The cooperation program is aligned both with the objectives and policies of the donor and the recipient.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>International Financing in Government and Staff Behaviour</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/post/2023-05-15-financiamiento-internacional-estructuras-gubernamentales-comportamiento-funcionarios/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 15 May 2023 00:00:00 -0300</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/post/2023-05-15-financiamiento-internacional-estructuras-gubernamentales-comportamiento-funcionarios/</guid>
      <description>
        
          &lt;h1 id=&#34;some-definitions&#34;&gt;Some Definitions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of this post on the basic principles of international financing, the term &amp;quot;Credit Agency (CA)&amp;quot; will be the one that grants a loan to a State, and the one that grants non-reimbursable resources &amp;quot;International Cooperation Agency or donor (ICA)&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference between both sources is that a loan (CA) must be repaid by the State and a cooperation resource (ICA) is non-reimbursable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both loans (CA) and grants (ICA) are structured through a project or program, depending on the grantor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the loans (CA) must be repaid by the receiving State, they carry an interest that we will call original and one or more punitive interest in case of sub-execution. We will call sub-execution the circumstance in which the objectives defined within the project have not been met in a timely manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the cases of non-reimbursable resources from International Cooperation agencies (ICA), these translate into obtaining: hiring consultancies, training or equipment related to the objectives of the project and the achievement of its results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is worth repeating: for a Government, it is safe to assume that the resources (both CA and ICA) are never freely available to the receiving country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;structuring-of-funds&#34;&gt;Structuring of funds&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then, if these funds are not freely available except within the framework of what is established in the project, what use are they? In principle, they represent a very effective means of advancing on key issues for a Government with the help of others who have already traveled the path before, allowing them to do so in less time and at a lower total cost. For example, if a Government desires to provide its citizens with a Comprehensive Health Service (CHS), it can request help from Canada (through its Cooperation agency (ICA), &lt;a href=&#34;https://cidpnsi.ca&#34;&gt;CanadaAid&lt;/a&gt; ), in the hope that it will share your experiences and sponsor its implementation, something that can be significantly more efficient than implementing the policy alone. In this case, of course &lt;a href=&#34;https://cidpnsi.ca&#34;&gt;CanadaAid&lt;/a&gt; would have an audit power over the development of the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can also happen that politically unstable states request a credit agency (CA) for a loan (e.g. &lt;a href=&#34;https://iadb.org&#34;&gt;Inter-American Development Bank - IADB&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.worldbank.org&#34;&gt;World Bank - WB&lt;/a&gt;, among others) for the sole purpose of stabilizing and guaranteeing the execution of a priority policy for the country. This, because upon receiving the funds, they also accept the external review of the grantor, who can apply sanctions for non-compliance with the project&#39;s objectives (punitive interests other than the original ones).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, it can be affirmed that the funds can only be granted through the approval of a project, which implies a detailed description of the objectives to be achieved, the stipulated execution period and the assigned resources (budget). On a recurring basis, the project is carried out by a local execution unit, which, if it does not have installed capacity, can be an international organization (such as the &lt;a href=&#34;https://undp.org&#34;&gt;United Nations Program for Development and Sustainable Life - UNDP&lt;/a&gt;), or a combination of both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is to say, everything is oriented towards a tight control of the finances and the objectives of the project, given that it is exercised by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the receiving State&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the project execution unit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The organization originating the funds, whether they are multilateral lending banks, regional banks and/or bilateral donors (CA and ICA).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Others involved (stakeholders)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-special-requests&#34;&gt;The &amp;quot;special requests&amp;quot;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is sometimes curious that in many jurisdictions, government officials do not seem to understand that the resources granted by these organizations (CA and ICA) cannot be used to cover expenses not related to the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have seen in some cases that, faced with this reality, officials try to make requests outside the project, in some cases we have observed how conferences have been organized in 5-star hotels not provided for in the project budget, or the hiring of a venue has been required unqualified but highly influential in key positions as a requirement for its continuity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this sense, it may happen that the receiving Government understands that the political and short-term objective takes precedence over the objective of the project but using resources for results not foreseen in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally, the organizations (both CA and ICA) do not grant funds for current expenses, such as salaries of public employees, electricity or gas bills, among others, financing in some cases only very short-term expert consultancies (for example 2 weeks) so that they can transmit their knowledge to the receiving State, usually with little impact, especially in cases of high staff turnover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-can-a-state-do-with-the-funds-granted-by-an-international-organization&#34;&gt;What can a State do with the funds granted by an international organization?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the funds have been granted and the project approved, it can be assumed that the negotiation stage is over, so that only what is included in the project can be executed. Sometimes, government officials do not understand this premise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is worth remembering that both the CAs and the ACIs can contribute to the achievement of the priority policies of the recipient country, which in turn are framed within the objectives of said organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hear you in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Organizational Change Tools in Government Structures</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/post/2023-04-18-herramientas-del-cambio-organizacional-en-estructuras-del-estado/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 18 Apr 2023 00:00:00 -0300</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/post/2023-04-18-herramientas-del-cambio-organizacional-en-estructuras-del-estado/</guid>
      <description>
        
          &lt;p&gt;Some of the most useful tools within the organizational change arsenal are not available (or their implementation is so complicated as to make it unfeasible) in State structures. Thus, staff dismissal, the tool to eliminate &lt;em&gt;rebellion focus&lt;/em&gt;, is normally contraindicated. We can say that a &lt;em&gt;rebellion focus&lt;/em&gt; is any pocket of resistance to change within the organization. Based on this, in general terms, the following tools are available instead:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Process automation&lt;/em&gt;: This tool is focused on studying those processes already running at the organzation, how support systems can be implemented, along with all the associated changes (legislation, internal regulations, personnel assignment, etc. ) to improve the efficiency of a process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Internal promotion campaign&lt;/em&gt;: This tool must be initiated even before starting the change tasks themselves. It must be focused on convincing current staff that the paradigm in use is insufficient to face the new challenges.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Charismatic internal champions&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Rebellion foci&lt;/em&gt; can be neutralized in many cases with internal change leaders (or champions) who raise the need to participate in the proposed change. In general, the best internal champions are those who were opponents in the past, since they are not only convinced of the change but also know the approaches of the opponents in detail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Training under the new paradigm&lt;/em&gt;: A paradigmatic change does not happen from one day to the next and for many employees it is impossible to assimilate without external help, since this change implies an abandonment of the old practices. For them, the training tasks are necessary to help them move onto the new paradigm. This training must cover not only its most outstanding aspects (such as systems or legal framework) but also its motivations and reasons. In addition, it must be continuous in time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Voluntary retirement&lt;/em&gt;: A common &lt;em&gt;rebellion focus&lt;/em&gt; is given by those who are in their last years of professional life and do not wish to change the methodology under any circumstances since they assume that with it they also change who they are. For them, a departure may be a voluntary retirement scheme that encourages them to leave the organization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Referral to a different area within the organization&lt;/em&gt;: If none of the above work, then a last-resort option is to move the problematic staff member to an area where he does not have to experience the full force of the organizational change, so that he does not feel the full impact.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This and other tools are available in the book &lt;a href=&#34;https://tienda.thomsonreuters.com.ar/978-987-03-4377-6%E2%80%8B-principios-de-administracion-tributaria/p&#34;&gt;Principios de Administración Tributaria&lt;/a&gt; published by Thomson Reuters - La Ley.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Seeking Help to Finance  Projects in Government: International Cooperation</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/post/2023-01-31-buscando-ayuda/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 31 Jan 2023 00:00:00 -0300</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/post/2023-01-31-buscando-ayuda/</guid>
      <description>
        
          &lt;p&gt;Welcome to a new year with a very interesting topic: The financing methods of Government institutions. I mean, not so much for its content, but the distance between what the common people believe and what it really is. For this article we have the help of one of the greatest specialists in International Cooperation in Argentina, Dr. Raquel Deas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to implementing changes in Government structures, financial resources determine almost all of the scope, since if funds are scarce or are not stable over time they will simply make the project unfeasible. In this sense, we can indicate that there are different forms of financing, for example International Cooperation, which will be discussed in this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;international-cooperation&#34;&gt;International Cooperation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many cases, in jurisdictions that qualify for this type of funding, international cooperation entities (or donors) will provide non-reimbursable funds for Goverment Modernization and improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this sense, it is necessary to point out that these &amp;quot;non-reimbursable funds&amp;quot; translate into the transfer of knowledge and technologies between countries and/or multilateral organizations, generally through inputs (consulting, equipment, and/or technical material and training).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simplified classification of the international cooperation sources can be determined on the actors involved:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Governmental
      &lt;ol&gt;
         &lt;li&gt; Bilateral
         &lt;ol&gt;
             &lt;li&gt; North-South: developed countries to less developed countries (colloquially coined ads &#34;first to third world&#34; funding).
             &lt;li&gt; South-South: countries of similar or equal relative development.
         &lt;/ol&gt;
         &lt;li&gt;Multilateral
             &lt;ol&gt;
                 &lt;li&gt; Global Organizations, mostly part of the UN, including UNDP, UNOPS and UNIDO.
                 &lt;li&gt;Regional Organizations, such as the OAS and regional tax organizations such as IOTA and CATA.
             &lt;/ol&gt;
         &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Non-Governmental
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is executed by Organisms, Associations, Foundations (collectively called NGOs).
&lt;li&gt;This type of cooperation also obeys political, social, economic, environmental, religious, and cultural interests, among others.
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;International cooperation scenarios are very dynamic at a global level in terms of objectives, volumes, beneficiaries and modalities, all of them subject to the conditionality of the different providers (economic, political, environmental and other priority criteria). This conditionality must be observed by the receiving States at the time of negotiation, making their priorities compatible with their feasibility in the global framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These scenarios must be observed by the receiving States when searching for sources in accordance with national priorities and their feasibility in the global framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;pros-and-cons-of-international-cooperation&#34;&gt;Pros and cons of international cooperation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Strengths&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Opportunities&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;• It allows modernization processes without monetary or budgetary cost for Government.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;• In the long term, it can improve Government services.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;• In case of political instability, this type of financing can allow the continuity of the project.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Weaknesses&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Threats&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;• Possible influence on the direction of the modernization project with the guidelines of the grantor of cooperation.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;• Cooperation may be jeopardized if the expected results are not obtained.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;• Technical cooperation may respond more to the interests (political, sale of technology, among others) of the donor than to the recipient&#39;s priorities.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;• Interference in internal affairs by the grantor of the cooperation.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This and other principles are available in the book &lt;a href=&#34;https://tienda.thomsonreuters.com.ar/978-987-03-4377-6%E2%80%8B-principios-de-administracion-tributaria/p&#34;&gt;Principios de Administración Tributaria&lt;/a&gt; published by Thomson Reuters - La Ley.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Although throughout history the natural support for documents was on paper, the truth is that this system has major disadvantages against new and better ways using computerized document management systems, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is prone to counterfeiting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It cannot be easily indexed (it can be indexed by hand, but at a very high cost), which generates unnecessary human input for its processing and prevents process automation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is a support that does not allow you to easily obtain backups of it (except for photocopies), so the loss or degradation of it requires requesting copies from the other party (in this case, the economic actor), with the risks that this entails.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is a medium that makes transparency difficult, since there can only be n copies of a file at the same time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, there are new methodologies that allow not only to guarantee the authenticity of the documents in it, but also in a transparent way for the end user, allowing these documents to be viewed from anywhere. In the same way, the documents included in these methodologies usually force a predefined structure (in other words, forms), which allows the automation of processes and indexing by different fields, which allows a fast and efficient operation and better auditing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, such methodologies have an Achilles heel in paper-based documents, since they are completely blind to them.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tax Administrations&#39; Rules: It is better to do before than after</title>

          &lt;p&gt;Human beings are very prone to making mistakes and forgetting things, especially in repetitive tasks. Therefore, it is much more efficient to use automated means - whenever possible - and try to have good quality information from the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many cases, this requires very intense work at first, but ensures relaxation later. In some administrations, a very strong inertia has been observed, which discourages the use of proven technologies and methodologies that can greatly help to control information, since they view these efforts as &amp;quot;unnecessary&amp;quot; or too costly, for example processing information from third parties. The reality is that the more it materializes before, the less effort will be necessary later, since the information will have fewer errors and inconsistencies, which normally results in a substantial improvement in collection at a significantly lower cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A special case, which is especially seen in smaller administrations and is more likely to fail, is that of the completeness of the taxpayer registry. In these cases, only taxpayers who are already liable for a tax are registered, so these administrations are blind to those potential taxpayers who are not registered, with the consequent loss of resources derived from those actors who operate only in the informal economy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Behavior Moderation Principle</title>

          &lt;p&gt;The tax system is - from the behavioral perspective - an incentive system, since States can use it to promote or discourage economic activities that it considers strategic. For example, a State may consider encouraging the services sector by alleviating taxes that affect it and discouraging the consumption of alcoholic beverages by creating a tax on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing it from this principle, any increase or decrease in tax burdens has an impact not only on the treasury coffers but on the entire economy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tax Administrations&#39; Rules: Taxpayers do not want to pay taxes</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/post/2022-09-22-nadie-quiere-pagar-impuestos/</link>

          &lt;p&gt;It is normal to forget this concept, but the truth is that it is not usual for some taxpayers to want to comply with their tax obligations voluntarily. However, in addition to being the least numerous, they are actually those that do not represent a collection problem for the administration and, of course, in the long term, all taxpayers are expected to voluntarily comply with their obligations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is possible to outline the universe of taxpayers as a pyramid, in such a way that the large taxpayers are at the top (since they are the least numerous), the medium-sized taxpayers in the center and the small taxpayers and those operators of the informal economy at the bottom. base. In this scenario, it is important to bear in mind that a general objective of a State is to ensure that the greatest number of economic actors progressively migrate towards the top of the pyramid, given that their progress is the progress of society as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following this line, it is possible to outline that an efficient tax system is one that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;has clear, simple rules and is expressed in a language that an average citizen can understand,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is transparent with its requirements and guidelines, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it is predictable over time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Tax Administrations&#39; Rules: Do not create  or raise taxes until all processes are optimized</title>

          &lt;p&gt;Although it is recurrent to try to cover public spending by increasing rates or creating new taxes, the reality is that - in general - this does not have the desired effect if the tax administration problems have not been solved beforehand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason for this is that although it is easier to carry out such action in the short term (raising a tax or creating it is normally a law and a form), in the medium and long term it generates great social discontent - given that by not increasing the only ones who were already paying the others will be subject to the new tax - and a tax cannibalization of other taxes. It can be said that tax cannibalization occurs when a taxpayer chooses whether to comply with their taxes when the tax pressure is excessive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, in no way does this imply that there are no ways to increase tax collection, but that it is necessary to improve all collection processes and once that route has been exhausted, only consider an increase in rates or the introduction of a new tax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a minimum, the following tasks should be accomplished:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure that the tax base or universe of taxpayers is registered in its entirety, in order to avoid economic actors who should declare and pay but escape the tax task.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;review and discard those debts that due to statute of limitations or proven uncollectibility are impossible to recover, in order to lighten the work of the collection areas and accelerate recovery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review and increase collection tasks for those taxpayers with tax debts, particularly in the friendly or administrative collection process when it exists because it is more expeditious. In the same sense, increase the tasks of omission management, to ensure that those taxpayers who are obliged to declare and do not do so, comply with that obligation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Analyze the impact of tax changes on taxpayers through statistics and simulations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Tax Administrations&#39; Rules: Do not only believe the Taxpayer</title>

          &lt;p&gt;This is perhaps the number one rule of the tax administration and the one that impacts most of the activities, since it invites to verify, in the most efficient and automatic way possible, what is indicated by the taxpayer in his interaction with the administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether due to ignorance, deliberate omission or negligence, it is likely that any given taxpayer will not be in a position to report a given value to the administration with 100% percent certainty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although this represents a serious problem for the administration, the reality is that it can be further mitigated by implementing cross-checks, that is, defining information channels that can be automatically validated. For example, if a taxpayer is required to declare the requested amount as a mortgage (something usual in the case of Income Tax, or, in Argentina, Income Tax), a channel with banking entities can be used to determine if the taxpayer has requested that amount from a bank and thus validate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, this requires a large amount of information to be available to verify these data, and if well designed it can be done automatically by the Administration, reducing costs and disputes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Savings Allocation Principle</title>

          &lt;p&gt;The amounts paid as taxes mainly affect the savings capacity of the affected taxpayers. In other words, if the tax pressure rises to a level that exceeds the savings capacity, it is expected that there will come a time when a taxpayer no longer complies with his tax obligations, forcing him to enter a &amp;quot;fiscal snowball&amp;quot;, a situation where, in the best scenario, he will subscribe to successive payment plans for the tax debts incurred until completely cease the debt based on the immensity of the debt based on their income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is, the optimal tax pressure operates on the surpluses that would otherwise go to savings. From this it follows that a tax burden that goes beyond these surpluses is doomed to failure, since even those who in good faith want to comply with it, will not be able to do so without dispensing with making other payments that are necessary, unnecessarily increasing the costs of collection and greatly affecting social dissatisfaction. Keep in mind that humans do not have a choice about whether or not to feed, and in extreme cases this activity will clearly be prioritized over any imposed load. In other words, if an individual is forced between fulfilling his tax obligations and paying for his basic needs, he will understandably always choose the latter.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Transparency Principle in a Tax Administration</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/post/2022-09-13-principio-de-transparencia/</link>

      <description>
        
          &lt;p&gt;The principle of transparency refers to the fact that all the actors involved in a transaction with the administration can check its sources, including returns, accounting statements and process data, depending on their level of responsibility in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This principle does not contradict the fiscal secrecy since it does not propose exposing the economic actor but simply allowing him to share the information held in the administration about himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advantages derived from this principle are much greater than its disadvantages, among which we can mention:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;allows a cross and detailed control, significantly improving the efficiency of the tax administration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;facilitates communication between the economic actor and the administration, since both parties can freely consult all the events that have taken place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;greatly restricts the arbitrariness perceived by economic actors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the application of this principle can be intimidating at first if it has never been implemented, but the truth is that its long-term benefits fully justify its incorporation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This and other principles are available in the book &lt;a href=&#34;https://tienda.thomsonreuters.com.ar/978-987-03-4377-6%E2%80%8B-principios-de-administracion-tributaria/p&#34;&gt;Principios de Administración Tributaria&lt;/a&gt; published by Thomson Reuters - La Ley.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;A few years ago a company that offers an accounting program in the United States asked me to evaluate the impact of BEPS in Mexico. From that study, which was much more than what they expected, this mini paper came out that you can consult &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/pdfs/mexico_beps_premier.pdf&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&#34;https://vixra.org/abs/1811.0098&#34;&gt;originally published here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tax Administration Principles</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/post/2022-06-22-principios-de-adm-tributaria/</link>

          &lt;p&gt;An interesting part of having worked in tax administrations for years is that you learn the general framework and best practices to get the job done. No matter the jurisdiction, at this point many of the problems that all of them present are the same and many times start from the fact that many of its members do not fully understand the reason for their actions. Yes, of course, they clearly see the micro, but many times they fail to see the macro, and thus, the set of tasks may sometimes not be the best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it was even more interesting to understand that much of what happens within one of these institutions is not publicly written, and therefore many of their officials are obliged either to &amp;quot;invent the wheel every time&amp;quot;, or to read notes or publications that really teach little (except isolated experiences in other parts of the world) or - if they are very lucky - go to a conference where they can learn something new, if the topic of the conference is really new. Many of the conferences, like everything in life, are only to present a result, but more than anything to make contacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;La Ley - Flyer 1&#34; src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/Prin_adm_trib_flyer_1.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this context, many people who want to learn and improve find themselves with a ceiling and the reality is that in my experience, no matter where in the world they are, the tasks are the same and the management is basically the same. And it turns out that I am not alone in this: in 2015 the International Monetary Fund made available to the public a tool that precisely helps States to estimate progress and use best practices, called &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tadat.org&#34;&gt;TADAT&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;La Ley - Flyer 2&#34; src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/Prin_adm_trib_flyer_2.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although this movement was long celebrated, given that it was now possible to compare tax administrations, in an equitable way, the truth is that there is a lack of a tax administration manual that shows in a didactic, unified and disinterested way the concepts, principles and best practices in the material along with ideas to apply, both for jurisdictions without resources and for those that want to improve every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Published in Spanish by Thomson Reuters - La Ley &lt;a href=&#34;https://tienda.thomsonreuters.com.ar/978-987-03-4377-6%E2%80%8B-principios-de-administracion-tributaria/p&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Case Selection in a Tax Administration: Managing Risk</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/post/2021-09-27-seleccion-de-casos/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 27 Sep 2021 00:00:00 -0300</pubDate>

      <description>
        
          &lt;p&gt;One of the advantages associated with collecting a large amount of information is that it can be used to determine patterns of behavior. One of the most common forms of use is through a Risk Matrix, which, taking registration information, declarations and third party information, among others, determines the risk of non-compliance through a polynomial calculation. This risk can be defined as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$ Matrix = (Risk; Quantity)$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;\( Risk = \sum\limits*{i=1}^n{a_i p_i} \)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;\( Quantity = \max\limits*{i=1}^n{(v_1)} \)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;\( p_i \) is the terms weight&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;\( a_i \) is the risk associated to a particular case&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;\( v_i \) is the monetary amount of the case&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;\( n \) is the number of cases&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;\( i \) is the count of cases&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Provided the following conditions are met :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;\( \sum\limits_{i=1}^n p_i = 1 \)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;\(0 \leq p_1 \leq 1 \)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this context, it is necessary to determine the types of data that can be part of the polynomial since they should be part of an ITAS:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Registration data, which are those that normally constitute systemic risks, since they do not imply specific behavior on the part of the taxpayer. These data can be differentiated into:
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;catalog data, in other words, those in which there are a finite number of possible elements, to which a fixed value is assigned. An example in this sense is the type of taxpayer, which in its most basic name includes only Individual and Corporate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Segmentation data, or those that are segmented into ranges or bands that have predefined values and are assigned a value based on them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Return data, which are perhaps the most widely used.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Third party data, given by the difference between the value declared by the taxpayer and the value reported by the third party.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Behavioral data, referring to the actions of the taxpayer in the tax administration. These usually include:
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;number of cases in collection management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;number of audit cases that resulted in an increase in the amount to be paid&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;number of cases in which the taxpayer declared the expiration date of the obligation passed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is then possible to assign each taxpayer a risk value made up of two elements: the probability that said taxpayer is in default and its value, calculated as the monetary difference that could arise if the default were to materialize. In this way, we can represent risk on the Cartesian plane, where Y represents the probability of default and X the monetary difference. Then, the risk matrix is the binary relationship (X and Y) of the risk values of each of the taxpayers for a given period, with the highest risk representing the highest probability and the highest monetary difference. If they are assigned to fixed spans, you can get something like the figure below, where the darkest spans are the riskiest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/Risk_Matrix_ejemplo.png&#34;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
      &lt;h4&gt;Risk Matrix Representation in the Cartesian plane&lt;/h4&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, having the taxpayers segmented is not enough. In the example shown in the previous figure at the end, there will be a number of taxpayers in each section that makes a good report, but more can be done. For example, if tasks are assigned to each of them, then ITAS can make decisions and initiate actions without human intervention, greatly improving overall performance and simplifying the overall case selection process. If we define that for sections 1 to 10 (the most risky) a complete audit will begin, for sections 11 to 28 a verification and for sections 29 to 55 a basic verification (and mostly computerized of their situation), we will have much of the work done. Of course, nothing prevents the definition of actions in other areas of the TA if it is considered pertinent, for example sections 65-72 are assigned as administrative collection cases, as long as the organizational framework allows it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, it is interesting to note that much of the selection work lies in defining the algorithm&#39;s operating parameters, which, being general, limit arbitrariness to a great extent and encourage transparency, but at the cost of having enough information about the taxpayer to take the best possible decisions and a detailed study that allows coupling with the proposed audit plan. In other words, it is useless, for example, to have a polynomial of the type \(Risk = Financial Institution * 0.5 + No Past Defaults * 0.5 \) if the number of taxpayers is minuscule and they have been recently audited. Nor is a polynomial of the type \(Risk = Lawyers * 0.5 + Accountants * 0.5 \) useful if the registry does not have external information, for example from the respective professional associations to validate the economic activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recurring theme in the implementation of a Risk Matrix consists of the distrust that initially generates a poor selection of cases (or in other words, not very interesting) based on errors in the information. In these cases - and until the cleanup of the information is finished - it is true that perhaps uninteresting cases can be selected from the point of inspection, but as they are completed, the percentage of interesting cases will grow as the information quality and organizational experience reach the appropriate level, so that without a doubt all cases are - in some way - interesting or useful for the audit function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As can be seen, the success of the Risk Matrix depends to a great extent on the information available in the ITAS, the quality of that data, external sources of information and a deep knowledge of the taxpayer base. On the other hand, once these obstacles have been overcome, it can be assumed that the definition of the risk polynimio is carried out together with the audit planning and then at the end of the period the results are controlled.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Project for an Argentine Tax Code</title>

          &lt;p&gt;Despite the changes proposed by the Central Administration, it is clear that one of the most important problems of current Argentine taxation is aging: The Tax Procedure act (numbered 11.683), was sanctioned in the 1930s, having its last revision in 1998. As a result, many of the solutions it proposes are outdated (for example, there were no computer systems at the time) or have changed so much that they are difficult to recognize (for example, the tax execution process).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make matters worse, there is a wide range of rules that regulate this activity, from laws and decrees to general DGI / AFIP resolutions, and even doctrine, since many concepts require clarification by the enforcement authorities. Projects such as the &lt;a href=&#34;https://biblioteca.afip.gov.ar&#34;&gt;AFIP electronic library&lt;/a&gt;, created at the end of the 90s, or &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.saij.gov.ar&#34;&gt;SAIJ&lt;/a&gt;, prior in time, have made it possible to reduce the cost of learning by offering an interface with all the references and modifications that a standard may have, but is not enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within this framework, about 15 years ago I began an exercise to compile and update tax regulations, from which a Draft Tax Code emerged that may be relevant in an economy depressed by COVID. Although it is clearly outdated, perhaps it can be restarted if there is enough interest from society, which at the time there was not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is always talk of a tax reform, but in general the pharaonic work that matters is underestimated, this being perhaps the time to unify criteria, update concepts and order the accounts, with the hope of having rules of the game that encourage investment, development and improve the quality of life for all, reducing costs for citizens and increasing efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can access a preview of this work here: &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/pdfs/apcta_main.pdf&#34;&gt;Draft Tax Code&lt;/a&gt; (in Spanish).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you like it and find it useful as an interesting starting point.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Impact of the human factor in a paradigmatic change in Tax Administrations</title>

          &lt;p&gt;This thesis was motivated by the lack of specific literature for organizational change in state structures mainly dedicated to tax administration, which has generated a culture of empiricism that can be clearly appreciated in different parts of the world, as will be seen during the developing. In principle, today the &amp;quot;engine of change&amp;quot; par excellence turns out to be technology (that is, the implementation of an ITAS or administrative management program), however, this factor is one among many others. In particular, this thesis was carried out in order to analyze the impact of the human factor on paradigmatic changes in tax administrations and the improvements that can be introduced to maximize them. For this, the applicable theory was analyzed and surveys have been carried out in different administrations (including organizations in Argentina, Guatemala and Barbados) and a series of interviews with specialists in the field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can consult it in &lt;a href=&#34;https://repositorio.utdt.edu/handle/utdt/1683&#34;&gt;the online library of the Torcuato Di Tella university&lt;/a&gt; (in Spanish).&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Some time ago, together with Alejandro Baranek, after a meeting with the creators of a digital currency called &lt;a href=&#34;https://monedapar.com.ar&#34;&gt;Moneda Par&lt;/a&gt;, we developed the theoretical framework for a digital currency that would solve some of the existing problems in Argentina at that time, mainly inflation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, Argentum emerged, whose paper can be consulted &lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.09569&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
