          &lt;p&gt;In international cooperation, there are several emerging trends that are influencing the way it is carried out. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focus on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): The SDGs, adopted by the United Nations in 2015, have gained great momentum and are guiding the international cooperation agenda. Cooperation efforts focus on addressing the 17 SDGs, ranging from eradicating poverty and hunger, to promoting gender equality, climate action and access to education and health.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Results-based development cooperation: There is a growing emphasis on impact measurement and accountability in international cooperation. The aim is to ensure that programs and projects are effective and generate tangible and measurable results in terms of development. This involves establishing performance indicators, conducting periodic evaluations, and using the results to improve practices and decision-making.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Innovation and technology: Innovation and technology are playing an increasingly important role in international cooperation. Innovative and technological solutions are explored to address development challenges, such as the use of artificial intelligence, mobile technology and digital platforms to improve access to basic services, humanitarian aid delivery and natural resource management.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Public-private collaboration: There is growing collaboration between the public and private sectors in international cooperation. Partnerships between governments, businesses, nonprofits, and civil society are emerging to address common challenges and leverage the resources and expertise of each sector. This includes public-private partnerships for infrastructure projects, corporate social responsibility programs and collaborations in areas such as health, education and entrepreneurship.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resilience and risk management focus: With the increase in natural disasters, conflicts and climate challenges, international cooperation is increasingly focusing on building resilience and risk management. This involves strengthening countries&#39; capacity to resist, adapt and recover from crises, and promoting disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation strategies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These trends reflect the evolution of international cooperation towards a more results-focused, sustainable, innovative and collaborative approach. As global challenges become more complex, these trends are expected to continue influencing the way international cooperation is carried out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are waiting for you in comments.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>International Cooperation: Origins of the Funds</title>

          &lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all aid received is the same and within the framework of International Technical Cooperation (ITC) this is no different. This post will deal only with the ITC, which is characterized by being non-reimbursable, unlike the funds granted by the Credit Agencies (CA) - for example the World Bank - as a loan. In the ITC, funds are not obtained, but inputs such as consultancies, equipment, training, technology transfer, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a note of color, we will not present real cases, not to confuse them, but as a measure of protection for the parties involved. If necessary, we will take the case exposed in the work &lt;a href=&#34;https://tienda.thomsonreuters.com.ar/978-987-03-4377-6%E2%80%8B-principios-de-tax-administration/p&#34;&gt;Principles of Tax Administration&lt;/a&gt; (In Spanish) of the People&#39;s Republic and Metropolis as a base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;funds-origin&#34;&gt;Fund&#39;s Origin&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;international-government-cooperation-igc&#34;&gt;International Government Cooperation (IGC)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s imagine that a country wants to help a third party through cooperation. It does this with its own resources, originating from the collection of taxes from its citizens, once their needs are covered. However, since resources are finite, the donor country must prioritize aid based on its strategic objectives, which may be economic, social, environmental or other. Then, Bilateral Technical Cooperation (BTC) is called that which occurs directly between two countries, a donor of funds and a recipient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may be the case that - depending on the objectives - the participation of several donors may be necessary for a single recipient, something that can occur in the African continent, forming something that we will call Mixed Bilateral Cooperation (MBC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both in the case of the BTC and the MBC, the management of these resources is carried out through the competent organizations in matters of cooperation of the different donor countries, such as the International Cooperation Agencies (ICA). As an example we can cite &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.usaid.gov&#34;&gt;USAID&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.giz.de/en/html/index.html&#34;&gt;giz&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, it may be the case that several countries come together to promote the advancement of a common axis in what we will call Multilateral Technical Cooperation (MTC), forming Multilateral Organizations for International Cooperation (MOIC). These organizations receive contributions from all their members, based on parameters such as the gross domestic product or GDP (ie, the higher the GDP, the greater the contribution) for channeling them to the different recipients. In other words, in these cases both the donor and recipient countries make contributions to the MOIC, based on the variables approved by the members to determine them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both in the BTC and in the MBC or the MTC, the donor&#39;s interest in the progress of the program on which the funds are based clearly emerges. Ultimately these are funds from taxpayers that could have financed goods and services within their borders but chose to do so elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;non-governmental-international-cooperation-ngic&#34;&gt;Non-Governmental International Cooperation (NGIC)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many cases it is not governments that donate the funds, but may also be non-governmental actors (for example, foundations), whose origin may be civil society donors, such as private banks. We will call these entities Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;quick-recap&#34;&gt;Quick Recap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on all of the above, we can say that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The funds donated arise mainly from  taxes that the donor collected or was able to collect and that he was able to use to finance programs within his borders but chose to do so through International Cooperation projects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In return for these funds, the donor must explain to its citizens the progress of the program and therefore has an interest in knowing its progress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since the funds are finite, the donor prioritizes the destination based on their needs and those of the recipients.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All member countries of an MOIC make a contribution, which depends on the amount based on pre-existing parameters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In no case do funds from non-reimbursable contributions come from nowhere, but are always based on taxes collected or that could be collected. In other words, the donations are based on the funds that certain countries (the donors) decided to invest in others with less relative development.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, it is possible to determine that a program will be viable if the following two conditions are true:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The donor country has the funds earmarked for ITC.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The cooperation program is aligned both with the objectives and policies of the donor and the recipient.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hear you in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;
