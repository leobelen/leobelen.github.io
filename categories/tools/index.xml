          &lt;p&gt;Some of the most useful tools within the organizational change arsenal are not available (or their implementation is so complicated as to make it unfeasible) in State structures. Thus, staff dismissal, the tool to eliminate &lt;em&gt;rebellion focus&lt;/em&gt;, is normally contraindicated. We can say that a &lt;em&gt;rebellion focus&lt;/em&gt; is any pocket of resistance to change within the organization. Based on this, in general terms, the following tools are available instead:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Process automation&lt;/em&gt;: This tool is focused on studying those processes already running at the organzation, how support systems can be implemented, along with all the associated changes (legislation, internal regulations, personnel assignment, etc. ) to improve the efficiency of a process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Internal promotion campaign&lt;/em&gt;: This tool must be initiated even before starting the change tasks themselves. It must be focused on convincing current staff that the  paradigm in use is insufficient to face the new challenges.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Charismatic internal champions&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Rebellion foci&lt;/em&gt; can be neutralized in many cases with internal change leaders (or champions) who raise the need to participate in the proposed change. In general, the best internal champions are those who were opponents in the past, since they are not only convinced of the change but also know the approaches of the opponents in detail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Training under the new paradigm&lt;/em&gt;: A paradigmatic change does not happen from one day to the next and for many employees it is impossible to assimilate without external help, since this change implies an abandonment of the old practices. For them, the training tasks are necessary to help them move onto the new paradigm. This training must cover not only its most outstanding aspects (such as systems or legal framework) but also its motivations and reasons. In addition, it must be continuous in time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Voluntary retirement&lt;/em&gt;: A common &lt;em&gt;rebellion focus&lt;/em&gt; is given by those who are in their last years of professional life and do not wish to change the methodology under any circumstances since they assume that with it they also change who they are. For them, a departure may be a voluntary retirement scheme that encourages them to leave the organization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Referral to a different area within the organization&lt;/em&gt;: If none of the above work, then a last-resort option is to move the problematic staff member to an area where he does not have to experience the full force of the organizational change, so that he does not feel the full impact.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This and other tools are available in the book &lt;a href=&#34;https://tienda.thomsonreuters.com.ar/978-987-03-4377-6%E2%80%8B-principios-de-administracion-tributaria/p&#34;&gt;Principios de Administración Tributaria&lt;/a&gt; published by Thomson Reuters - La Ley.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Seeking Help to Finance  Projects in Government: International Cooperation</title>
      <link>https://leobelen.github.io/post/2023-01-31-buscando-ayuda/</link>

      <description>
        
          &lt;p&gt;Welcome to a new year with a very interesting topic: The financing methods of Government institutions. I mean, not so much for its content, but the distance between what the common people believe and what it really is. For this article we have the help of one of the greatest specialists in International Cooperation in Argentina, Dr. Raquel Deas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to implementing changes in Government structures, financial resources determine almost all of the scope, since if funds are scarce or are not stable over time they will simply make the project unfeasible. In this sense, we can indicate that there are different forms of financing, for example International Cooperation, which will be discussed in this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;international-cooperation&#34;&gt;International Cooperation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many cases, in jurisdictions that qualify for this type of funding, international cooperation entities (or donors) will provide non-reimbursable funds for Goverment Modernization and improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this sense, it is necessary to point out that these &amp;quot;non-reimbursable funds&amp;quot; translate into the transfer of knowledge and technologies between countries and/or multilateral organizations, generally through inputs (consulting, equipment, and/or technical material and training).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simplified classification of the international cooperation sources can be determined on the actors involved:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Governmental
      &lt;ol&gt;
         &lt;li&gt; Bilateral
         &lt;ol&gt;
             &lt;li&gt; North-South: developed countries to less developed countries (colloquially coined ads &#34;first to third world&#34; funding).
             &lt;li&gt; South-South: countries of similar or equal relative development.
         &lt;/ol&gt;
         &lt;li&gt;Multilateral
             &lt;ol&gt;
                 &lt;li&gt; Global Organizations, mostly part of the UN, including UNDP, UNOPS and UNIDO.
                 &lt;li&gt;Regional Organizations, such as the OAS and regional tax organizations such as IOTA and CATA.
             &lt;/ol&gt;
         &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Non-Governmental
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is executed by Organisms, Associations, Foundations (collectively called NGOs).
&lt;li&gt;This type of cooperation also obeys political, social, economic, environmental, religious, and cultural interests, among others.
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;International cooperation scenarios are very dynamic at a global level in terms of objectives, volumes, beneficiaries and modalities, all of them subject to the conditionality of the different providers (economic, political, environmental and other priority criteria). This conditionality must be observed by the receiving States at the time of negotiation, making their priorities compatible with their feasibility in the global framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These scenarios must be observed by the receiving States when searching for sources in accordance with national priorities and their feasibility in the global framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;pros-and-cons-of-international-cooperation&#34;&gt;Pros and cons of international cooperation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Strengths&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Opportunities&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;• It allows modernization processes without monetary or budgetary cost for Government.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;• In the long term, it can improve Government services.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;• In case of political instability, this type of financing can allow the continuity of the project.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Weaknesses&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Threats&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;• Possible influence on the direction of the modernization project with the guidelines of the grantor of cooperation.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;• Cooperation may be jeopardized if the expected results are not obtained.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;• Technical cooperation may respond more to the interests (political, sale of technology, among others) of the donor than to the recipient&#39;s priorities.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;• Interference in internal affairs by the grantor of the cooperation.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This and other principles are available in the book &lt;a href=&#34;https://tienda.thomsonreuters.com.ar/978-987-03-4377-6%E2%80%8B-principios-de-administracion-tributaria/p&#34;&gt;Principios de Administración Tributaria&lt;/a&gt; published by Thomson Reuters - La Ley.&lt;/p&gt;
