            &lt;p&gt;In recent years, blockchain technology has been heralded as a revolutionary force in various sectors, including tax and financial administration systems. However, as the initial hype subsides, it&amp;rsquo;s crucial to examine the real-world applications, challenges, and ongoing efforts in this domain from a skeptical perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;real-uses-of-blockchain-in-itas-and-ifas&#34;&gt;Real Uses of Blockchain in ITAS and IFAS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While blockchain has been touted as a panacea for many administrative challenges, its actual implementation in tax and financial systems has been more limited than initially predicted.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;In an era of rapid technological advancement, the integration of tax administration systems with financial institution systems has become a topic of significant interest globally. This blog post explores how an Integrated Tax Administration System (ITAS) could be adapted for use in banking institutions, the technologies and concepts needed for implementation, and whether the differences between tax and financial systems can be reconciled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;adapting-itas-for-banking-institutions&#34;&gt;Adapting ITAS for Banking Institutions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Integrated Tax Administration Systems (ITAS) are designed to simplify and automate tax administration processes, including filing returns and making payments online&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. While primarily developed for tax authorities, the core principles and functionalities of ITAS could be adapted to enhance banking operations and compliance.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;In the realm of tax administration, a self-declaration system is one where taxpayers are responsible for declaring their income, calculating their tax liability, and ensuring timely payment. This system places several obligations on taxpayers, which are crucial for maintaining compliance and ensuring the effective functioning of tax systems globally. Let&amp;rsquo;s delve into the key types of obligations in a self-declaration system: the obligation to file, the obligation to pay, and the obligation to inform.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Understanding Tax Collection: Administrative vs. Enforced Collection</title>

            &lt;p&gt;Tax collection is a critical function of any government, providing the necessary revenue to fund public services and infrastructure. There are two primary methods of tax collection: administrative collection and enforced collection. Understanding the differences between these two approaches and implementing best practices can significantly enhance tax revenue collection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;differences-between-administrative-and-enforced-collection&#34;&gt;Differences Between Administrative and Enforced Collection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Administrative Collection&lt;/em&gt;: This method involves the routine collection of taxes through voluntary compliance. Taxpayers are encouraged to file their tax returns and pay their taxes on time through various means, including clear communication, easy payment options, and incentives for timely payment. Administrative collection relies on the cooperation of taxpayers and is generally less costly than enforced collection&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Enforced Collection&lt;/em&gt;: This approach involves the use of legal measures to collect taxes from non-compliant taxpayers. It includes actions such as audits, penalties, and legal proceedings to enforce tax payment. Enforced collection is more costly and time-consuming but necessary to ensure that all taxpayers contribute their fair share&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;best-practices-for-maximizing-tax-collection&#34;&gt;Best Practices for Maximizing Tax Collection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maximizing tax collection requires a balanced approach that includes both administrative and enforced collection strategies. Here are some best practices:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Accrual vs Accounting and Cash Accounting: A Beginner&#39;s Guide</title>
      <link>https://leobelen.github.io/post/2024-09-30-contabilidad-patrimonial-vs-contabilidad-de-caja-una-guia-para-principiantes/</link>

      <description>
        
          
            &lt;p&gt;Accrual Accounting and Cash Basis Accounting are two different methods of recording financial transactions. The main difference lies in the timing of when revenue and expenses are recognized&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Accrual Accounting, transactions are recorded when they occur, regardless of when cash is actually received or paid out. This means that revenue is recognized when it is earned and expenses are recognized when they are incurred&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref1:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Cash Basis Accounting only records revenue and expenses when cash is actually received or paid out. This method provides an immediate recognition of cash inflows and outflows&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref2:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Taxation is a fundamental aspect of any functioning society, providing the necessary resources for governments to deliver essential public services. However, tax administrations often face significant challenges when it comes to engaging with taxpayers and fostering a culture of voluntary compliance. In this blog post, we will explore the issues surrounding taxpayer engagement, the maxim that no one wants to pay taxes, and the relationship between taxes paid and perceived taxpayer satisfaction in the community.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Compatibilizing Metrics in Management: Creating a Points System</title>

            &lt;p&gt;In the realm of management, one of the foremost challenges is aligning various metrics to create a cohesive and effective evaluation system. A points system can serve as a powerful tool to harmonize these metrics, allowing organizations to measure performance across diverse areas in a standardized manner. This approach not only facilitates objective assessment but also encourages employees to focus on key performance indicators that drive the organization&amp;rsquo;s success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-need-for-a-unified-metrics-system&#34;&gt;The Need for a Unified Metrics System&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organizations often grapple with disparate metrics that can lead to fragmented evaluations. For instance, sales departments might focus on revenue targets, while customer service teams prioritize satisfaction scores. A points system can bridge these gaps by assigning weighted values to each metric, thereby creating a unified framework for assessment. This system ensures that all departments are aligned with the organization&amp;rsquo;s overarching goals.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Tax compliance plays a crucial role in the functioning of governments and societies. It ensures that governments have the necessary revenue to provide essential goods and services to their citizens, such as education, healthcare, infrastructure, and social welfare programs. Without a consistent stream of tax revenue, governments would struggle to balance their budgets and meet the needs of their populations&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-tax-compliance-matters&#34;&gt;Why Tax Compliance Matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The importance of tax compliance extends beyond just balancing government budgets. It also promotes fairness and equity in society. When individuals and businesses comply with tax laws, they contribute their fair share to the common good. This helps to reduce income inequality and ensure that the tax burden is distributed more evenly across society&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref1:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Tax administration audits play a crucial role in ensuring the integrity and efficiency of tax systems worldwide. They serve as a mechanism to verify the accuracy of tax returns and ensure compliance with tax laws. By conducting audits, tax authorities can detect and deter tax evasion and fraud, which ultimately helps in safeguarding the revenue base of a country. This is essential for funding public services and infrastructure, which are vital for economic growth and societal well-being.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Tax administration plays a pivotal role in ensuring that governments can effectively collect revenue and maintain economic stability. Understanding the different stages of tax administration is essential for identifying areas for improvement and implementing effective strategies. This blog will describe each tax administration stage, provide a questionnaire to determine a country&amp;rsquo;s tax administration stage, and present examples of countries at each stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although more specialized tools like &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tadat.org&#34;&gt;TADAT&lt;/a&gt; exist, they require more information than a taxpayer would typically have. The present questionnaire is intended only for guidance. Additionally, the different countries referenced at each stage are based on external observations and may change over time.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Taxpayer registration is a fundamental component of effective tax administration, serving as the backbone for accurate revenue collection and compliance enforcement. It involves officially recognizing individuals, businesses, and entities that are obligated to pay taxes. This process is not merely bureaucratic; it is crucial for establishing a clear and organized tax system that promotes transparency and accountability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;foundation-for-revenue-collection&#34;&gt;Foundation for Revenue Collection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary importance of taxpayer registration lies in its role as the foundation for revenue collection. An accurate and comprehensive taxpayer register allows tax authorities to identify who is required to pay taxes, thereby facilitating the assessment and collection processes. According to the OECD, a well-functioning tax administration relies heavily on a robust registration system to support its operations, including filing, assessment, payment, and collection&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Without a reliable register, tax administrations risk losing significant revenue due to unregistered taxpayers or inaccuracies in taxpayer information.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Improving tax administration processes is crucial for enhancing government revenue and ensuring compliance among taxpayers. As countries strive for better tax collection, various strategies and technologies can be employed to streamline operations and boost efficiency. This blog explores how to improve tax administration processes, the role of technology, and identifies key donors by region that support these initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;embrace-digital-transformation&#34;&gt;Embrace Digital Transformation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digital transformation is a critical step for tax administrations aiming to modernize their processes. The evolution from traditional manual systems to digital frameworks can significantly enhance efficiency. Tax administrations are currently transitioning through three stages&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why Changing Income Tax Regulations Mid-Tax Period is Impractical</title>

            &lt;p&gt;Changing income tax regulations in the middle of a tax period can have significant consequences for taxpayers and tax authorities alike. In this blog post, we will explore the reasons why such changes are generally considered impractical, with a particular focus on the case of Argentina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;disruption-to-tax-planning&#34;&gt;Disruption to Tax Planning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the primary reasons why mid-period tax changes are problematic is that they disrupt taxpayers&amp;rsquo; ability to plan their finances effectively. Individuals and businesses make financial decisions based on the existing tax laws, and sudden changes can throw these plans into disarray. For example, if a taxpayer has made investments or financial commitments based on the current tax regime, a mid-period change could significantly alter the expected returns or costs associated with those decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Tax administration is a critical function for governments in the developing world, as it provides the revenue needed to fund essential public services and infrastructure. However, tax administrations in these countries often face significant challenges that can hinder their effectiveness and efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;challenges-in-developing-countries&#34;&gt;Challenges in Developing Countries&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the primary challenges is the large informal sector, where economic activity takes place outside the formal tax system. This makes it difficult for tax administrations to accurately identify and assess the tax liabilities of a significant portion of the population&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Additionally, many developing countries struggle with low taxpayer compliance, as citizens may be distrustful of the government or lack understanding of their tax obligations&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2 id=&#34;the-importance-of-data-within-a-tax-administration-system-in-the-developing-world&#34;&gt;The Importance of Data within a Tax Administration System in the Developing World&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the developing world, tax administrations often face significant challenges in effectively collecting revenue and ensuring compliance. One of the key factors that can help address these challenges is the strategic use of data within the tax administration system&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accurate and comprehensive data is essential for tax authorities to identify the true tax base, monitor compliance, and facilitate efficient tax collection. In developing countries, where the informal economy and tax evasion are prevalent, leveraging data can be a game-changer.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;As a revenue administration, collecting income tax effectively is crucial for funding public services and driving economic growth. However, many countries struggle with low compliance rates and inefficient collection processes. In this blog post, we&amp;rsquo;ll explore key strategies to enhance income tax collection, drawing insights from successful reforms in various countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;simplifying-the-tax-system&#34;&gt;Simplifying the Tax System&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most effective ways to improve income tax collection is by simplifying the tax system. Georgia&amp;rsquo;s experience illustrates this well. After the 2003 Rose Revolution, the government simplified the tax code, reduced rates, and eliminated minor local taxes that generated little revenue. The number of taxes was reduced from 21 to just 7, and many rates were lowered. This made the system more transparent and easier for taxpayers to understand and comply with&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Tax fraud is a significant issue that affects economies worldwide, with estimates suggesting it accounts for between 4% and 15% of the tax gap in various OECD countries&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Combating tax fraud is crucial for maintaining the integrity of tax systems and ensuring governments receive the revenue needed to fund public services. In recent years, tax authorities have increasingly adopted integrated tax administration systems, including artificial intelligence (AI), to enhance their ability to detect and prevent tax fraud. However, the lack of such systems can severely hinder the effectiveness of tax authorities in this endeavor.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Tax collection is a critical issue for developing countries, as it provides the revenue needed to fund public services, infrastructure, and economic development. However, many developing nations struggle with low tax compliance and collection rates. One potential solution that has been gaining attention is the adoption of accrual accounting principles by governments and tax authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accrual accounting is an accounting method that records revenues and expenses when they are incurred, rather than when cash is exchanged. This provides a more accurate picture of a company or organization&amp;rsquo;s financial position and performance compared to cash basis accounting&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. While accrual accounting is the standard for businesses worldwide, many governments still use cash basis accounting, recording transactions only when cash is received or paid out.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Tax administration in developing countries faces significant challenges in collecting revenue efficiently and equitably. Low tax-to-GDP ratios, high rates of informality, limited taxpayer compliance, and outdated technology all hinder the ability of tax authorities to mobilize domestic resources. However, with the right reforms and investments, these obstacles can be overcome to strengthen fiscal capacity and support economic development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-promise-and-limitations-of-technology&#34;&gt;The Promise and Limitations of Technology&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology has immense potential to transform tax administration in developing countries by improving taxpayer identification, enhancing compliance monitoring, and facilitating voluntary compliance&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Digital tools like electronic fiscal devices, e-filing, and e-payments can help tax authorities create comprehensive taxpayer databases, automatically cross-check reported liabilities against third-party data, and provide convenient services to taxpayers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An important part of the general proposal, initiated by the previous posts (in particular the &lt;a href=&#34;https://leobelen.github.io/post/2022-06-22-principios-de-adm-tributaria/&#34;&gt;tax administration manual&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://leobelen.github.io/post/2021-08-01-un-anteproyecto-de-codigo-tributario-argentino/&#34;&gt;draft Tax Code&lt;/a&gt;) is the program that can be used to carry it out. Actually, some time ago I developed an Integrated Tax Administration System (ITAS), called Antares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;architecture&#34;&gt;Architecture&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the beginning, the project was focused as a tool that could meet the following characteristics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;be easy to install and test.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;highly parameterizable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;based on free software technologies (such as the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/&#34;&gt;GNU&lt;/a&gt; license).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of the above, the system works with the following technological components:&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
        
          
            &lt;p&gt;In international cooperation, there are several emerging trends that are influencing the way it is carried out. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focus on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): The SDGs, adopted by the United Nations in 2015, have gained great momentum and are guiding the international cooperation agenda. Cooperation efforts focus on addressing the 17 SDGs, ranging from eradicating poverty and hunger, to promoting gender equality, climate action and access to education and health.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Results-based development cooperation: There is a growing emphasis on impact measurement and accountability in international cooperation. The aim is to ensure that programs and projects are effective and generate tangible and measurable results in terms of development. This involves establishing performance indicators, conducting periodic evaluations, and using the results to improve practices and decision-making.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Innovation and technology: Innovation and technology are playing an increasingly important role in international cooperation. Innovative and technological solutions are explored to address development challenges, such as the use of artificial intelligence, mobile technology and digital platforms to improve access to basic services, humanitarian aid delivery and natural resource management.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Public-private collaboration: There is growing collaboration between the public and private sectors in international cooperation. Partnerships between governments, businesses, nonprofits, and civil society are emerging to address common challenges and leverage the resources and expertise of each sector. This includes public-private partnerships for infrastructure projects, corporate social responsibility programs and collaborations in areas such as health, education and entrepreneurship.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resilience and risk management focus: With the increase in natural disasters, conflicts and climate challenges, international cooperation is increasingly focusing on building resilience and risk management. This involves strengthening countries&amp;rsquo; capacity to resist, adapt and recover from crises, and promoting disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation strategies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These trends reflect the evolution of international cooperation towards a more results-focused, sustainable, innovative and collaborative approach. As global challenges become more complex, these trends are expected to continue influencing the way international cooperation is carried out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not all aid received is the same and within the framework of International Technical Cooperation (ITC) this is no different. This post will deal only with the ITC, which is characterized by being non-reimbursable, unlike the funds granted by the Credit Agencies (CA) - for example the World Bank - as a loan. In the ITC, funds are not obtained, but inputs such as consultancies, equipment, training, technology transfer, among others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of this post on the basic principles of international financing, the term &amp;ldquo;Credit Agency (CA)&amp;rdquo; will be the one that grants a loan to a State, and the one that grants non-reimbursable resources &amp;ldquo;International Cooperation Agency or donor (ICA)&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference between both sources is that a loan (CA) must be repaid by the State and a cooperation resource (ICA) is non-reimbursable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both loans (CA) and grants (ICA) are structured through a project or program, depending on the grantor.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Organizational Change Tools in Government Structures</title>

      <description>
        
          
            &lt;p&gt;Some of the most useful tools within the organizational change arsenal are not available (or their implementation is so complicated as to make it unfeasible) in State structures. Thus, staff dismissal, the tool to eliminate &lt;em&gt;rebellion focus&lt;/em&gt;, is normally contraindicated. We can say that a &lt;em&gt;rebellion focus&lt;/em&gt; is any pocket of resistance to change within the organization. Based on this, in general terms, the following tools are available instead:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Process automation&lt;/em&gt;: This tool is focused on studying those processes already running at the organzation, how support systems can be implemented, along with all the associated changes (legislation, internal regulations, personnel assignment, etc. ) to improve the efficiency of a process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Internal promotion campaign&lt;/em&gt;: This tool must be initiated even before starting the change tasks themselves. It must be focused on convincing current staff that the paradigm in use is insufficient to face the new challenges.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Charismatic internal champions&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Rebellion foci&lt;/em&gt; can be neutralized in many cases with internal change leaders (or champions) who raise the need to participate in the proposed change. In general, the best internal champions are those who were opponents in the past, since they are not only convinced of the change but also know the approaches of the opponents in detail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Training under the new paradigm&lt;/em&gt;: A paradigmatic change does not happen from one day to the next and for many employees it is impossible to assimilate without external help, since this change implies an abandonment of the old practices. For them, the training tasks are necessary to help them move onto the new paradigm. This training must cover not only its most outstanding aspects (such as systems or legal framework) but also its motivations and reasons. In addition, it must be continuous in time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Voluntary retirement&lt;/em&gt;: A common &lt;em&gt;rebellion focus&lt;/em&gt; is given by those who are in their last years of professional life and do not wish to change the methodology under any circumstances since they assume that with it they also change who they are. For them, a departure may be a voluntary retirement scheme that encourages them to leave the organization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Referral to a different area within the organization&lt;/em&gt;: If none of the above work, then a last-resort option is to move the problematic staff member to an area where he does not have to experience the full force of the organizational change, so that he does not feel the full impact.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This and other tools are available in the book &lt;a href=&#34;https://tienda.thomsonreuters.com.ar/978-987-03-4377-6%E2%80%8B-principios-de-administracion-tributaria/p&#34;&gt;Principios de Administración Tributaria&lt;/a&gt; published by Thomson Reuters - La Ley.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Seeking Help to Finance  Projects in Government: International Cooperation</title>

            &lt;p&gt;Welcome to a new year with a very interesting topic: The financing methods of Government institutions. I mean, not so much for its content, but the distance between what the common people believe and what it really is. For this article we have the help of one of the greatest specialists in International Cooperation in Argentina, Dr. Raquel Deas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to implementing changes in Government structures, financial resources determine almost all of the scope, since if funds are scarce or are not stable over time they will simply make the project unfeasible. In this sense, we can indicate that there are different forms of financing, for example International Cooperation, which will be discussed in this post.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tax Administrations&#39; Rules: Discard the use of paper as documentary support</title>
      <link>https://leobelen.github.io/post/2022-12-26-descartando-el-papel-como-soporte-documental/</link>

            &lt;p&gt;Although throughout history the natural support for documents was on paper, the truth is that this system has major disadvantages against new and better ways using computerized document management systems, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is prone to counterfeiting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It cannot be easily indexed (it can be indexed by hand, but at a very high cost), which generates unnecessary human input for its processing and prevents process automation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is a support that does not allow you to easily obtain backups of it (except for photocopies), so the loss or degradation of it requires requesting copies from the other party (in this case, the economic actor), with the risks that this entails.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is a medium that makes transparency difficult, since there can only be n copies of a file at the same time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, there are new methodologies that allow not only to guarantee the authenticity of the documents in it, but also in a transparent way for the end user, allowing these documents to be viewed from anywhere. In the same way, the documents included in these methodologies usually force a predefined structure (in other words, forms), which allows the automation of processes and indexing by different fields, which allows a fast and efficient operation and better auditing.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Human beings are very prone to making mistakes and forgetting things, especially in repetitive tasks. Therefore, it is much more efficient to use automated means - whenever possible - and try to have good quality information from the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many cases, this requires very intense work at first, but ensures relaxation later. In some administrations, a very strong inertia has been observed, which discourages the use of proven technologies and methodologies that can greatly help to control information, since they view these efforts as &amp;ldquo;unnecessary&amp;rdquo; or too costly, for example processing information from third parties. The reality is that the more it materializes before, the less effort will be necessary later, since the information will have fewer errors and inconsistencies, which normally results in a substantial improvement in collection at a significantly lower cost.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Behavior Moderation Principle</title>

            &lt;p&gt;The tax system is - from the behavioral perspective - an incentive system, since States can use it to promote or discourage economic activities that it considers strategic. For example, a State may consider encouraging the services sector by alleviating taxes that affect it and discouraging the consumption of alcoholic beverages by creating a tax on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing it from this principle, any increase or decrease in tax burdens has an impact not only on the treasury coffers but on the entire economy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tax Administrations&#39; Rules: Taxpayers do not want to pay taxes</title>

      <description>
        
          
            &lt;p&gt;It is normal to forget this concept, but the truth is that it is not usual for some taxpayers to want to comply with their tax obligations voluntarily. However, in addition to being the least numerous, they are actually those that do not represent a collection problem for the administration and, of course, in the long term, all taxpayers are expected to voluntarily comply with their obligations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is possible to outline the universe of taxpayers as a pyramid, in such a way that the large taxpayers are at the top (since they are the least numerous), the medium-sized taxpayers in the center and the small taxpayers and those operators of the informal economy at the bottom. base. In this scenario, it is important to bear in mind that a general objective of a State is to ensure that the greatest number of economic actors progressively migrate towards the top of the pyramid, given that their progress is the progress of society as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Although it is recurrent to try to cover public spending by increasing rates or creating new taxes, the reality is that - in general - this does not have the desired effect if the tax administration problems have not been solved beforehand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason for this is that although it is easier to carry out such action in the short term (raising a tax or creating it is normally a law and a form), in the medium and long term it generates great social discontent - given that by not increasing the only ones who were already paying the others will be subject to the new tax - and a tax cannibalization of other taxes. It can be said that tax cannibalization occurs when a taxpayer chooses whether to comply with their taxes when the tax pressure is excessive.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;This is perhaps the number one rule of the tax administration and the one that impacts most of the activities, since it invites to verify, in the most efficient and automatic way possible, what is indicated by the taxpayer in his interaction with the administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether due to ignorance, deliberate omission or negligence, it is likely that any given taxpayer will not be in a position to report a given value to the administration with 100% percent certainty.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;The amounts paid as taxes mainly affect the savings capacity of the affected taxpayers. In other words, if the tax pressure rises to a level that exceeds the savings capacity, it is expected that there will come a time when a taxpayer no longer complies with his tax obligations, forcing him to enter a &amp;ldquo;fiscal snowball&amp;rdquo;, a situation where, in the best scenario, he will subscribe to successive payment plans for the tax debts incurred until completely cease the debt based on the immensity of the debt based on their income.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;The principle of transparency refers to the fact that all the actors involved in a transaction with the administration can check its sources, including returns, accounting statements and process data, depending on their level of responsibility in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This principle does not contradict the fiscal secrecy since it does not propose exposing the economic actor but simply allowing him to share the information held in the administration about himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advantages derived from this principle are much greater than its disadvantages, among which we can mention:&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;A few years ago a company that offers an accounting program in the United States asked me to evaluate the impact of BEPS in Mexico. From that study, which was much more than what they expected, this mini paper came out that you can consult &lt;a href=&#34;https://leobelen.github.io/pdfs/mexico_beps_premier.pdf&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&#34;https://vixra.org/abs/1811.0098&#34;&gt;originally published here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;An interesting part of having worked in tax administrations for years is that you learn the general framework and best practices to get the job done. No matter the jurisdiction, at this point many of the problems that all of them present are the same and many times start from the fact that many of its members do not fully understand the reason for their actions. Yes, of course, they clearly see the micro, but many times they fail to see the macro, and thus, the set of tasks may sometimes not be the best.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;One of the advantages associated with collecting a large amount of information is that it can be used to determine patterns of behavior. One of the most common forms of use is through a Risk Matrix, which, taking registration information, declarations and third party information, among others, determines the risk of non-compliance through a polynomial calculation. This risk can be defined as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$ Matrix = (Risk; Quantity)$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;\( Risk = \sum\limits*{i=1}^n{a_i p_i} \)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;\( Quantity = \max\limits*{i=1}^n{(v_1)} \)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;\( p_i \) is the terms weight&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;\( a_i \) is the risk associated to a particular case&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;\( v_i \) is the monetary amount of the case&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;\( n \) is the number of cases&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;\( i \) is the count of cases&lt;/li&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Despite the changes proposed by the Central Administration, it is clear that one of the most important problems of current Argentine taxation is aging: The Tax Procedure act (numbered 11.683), was sanctioned in the 1930s, having its last revision in 1998. As a result, many of the solutions it proposes are outdated (for example, there were no computer systems at the time) or have changed so much that they are difficult to recognize (for example, the tax execution process).&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;This thesis was motivated by the lack of specific literature for organizational change in state structures mainly dedicated to tax administration, which has generated a culture of empiricism that can be clearly appreciated in different parts of the world, as will be seen during the developing. In principle, today the &amp;ldquo;engine of change&amp;rdquo; par excellence turns out to be technology (that is, the implementation of an ITAS or administrative management program), however, this factor is one among many others. In particular, this thesis was carried out in order to analyze the impact of the human factor on paradigmatic changes in tax administrations and the improvements that can be introduced to maximize them. For this, the applicable theory was analyzed and surveys have been carried out in different administrations (including organizations in Argentina, Guatemala and Barbados) and a series of interviews with specialists in the field.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Some time ago, together with Alejandro Baranek, after a meeting with the creators of a digital currency called &lt;a href=&#34;https://monedapar.com.ar&#34;&gt;Moneda Par&lt;/a&gt;, we developed the theoretical framework for a digital currency that would solve some of the existing problems in Argentina at that time, mainly inflation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, Argentum emerged, whose paper can be consulted &lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.09569&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
